            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Totems of Time is a 3D Puzzle Game in which the player is trapped on a stranded island.
              The goal of the game is to have the player figure a way out through the island by solving puzzles while time travelling between the past and present in order to escape the island

            <p> Since the project was quite open-ended, there were no constraints in terms of creativity and designs of the game as long as it meets the coding requirements needed in the program.
              We went forward with the idea of a 3D Puzzle solving game with a time travel mechanic as it was a unique.

            <p>My job includes designing the entire layout of the game as well as creating the overall User Interface of the game.
              Whenever I finished the design of one level, Our 3D assets creator, Jason would take this into the Unity and place block mesh of the level
              while also referencing my design of the levels. I also designed the challenges in all levels and the overall game mechanic.</p>

          <p>In the game we have a guide for players to help them traverse through the levels with Journal. These journal pages are scattered throughout the levels in the game and
            the player has to pick them up to be able to see the guide provided. I designed all the journals and the guide, as can be seen in the image above, there were some challenges I faced
          throughout making the journals, but eventually I was able to find the right design.</p>
          <p>The overall user interface design was created by me. I kept in mind of the original design of the game, the colour palette that we have for the game, as well as the font choices
          that better suited for our game theme. After the designs were created, I imported these into the unity assets folder and coded the game menu. </p>

        <div class="proj-child">
          <h1>Reflection & result</h1>
          <p>Based on this game alone, I realized there are many different possibilities that can be created with coding and designing. If I were given the chance, I could have definitely done better with
            the UI design, choosing ones that suit the best for the game, and create more challenging levels into the game. There were some main mechanics that did not get implemented in the game
            because of the time restriction, but we were able to improvise and went with different mechanic that also fits well with the game.
